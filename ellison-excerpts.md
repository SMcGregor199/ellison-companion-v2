### "The World and the Jug" – Excerpt 1 

> "First, three questions: Why is it so often true that when critics confront the American as *Negro*
> they suddenly drop their advanced critical armament and revert with an air of confident superiority > to quite primitive modes of analysis? Why is it that sociology-oriented critics seem to rate 
> literature so far below politics and ideology that they would rather kill a novel than modify their
> presumptions concerning a given reality which it seeks in its own terms to project? Finally, why 
> is it that so many of those who would tell us the meaning of Negro life never bother to learn how
> varied it really is?" - Ralph Ellison, “The World and the Jug”, in *The Collected Essays of Ralph 
> Ellison*, ed. John F.Callahan, Modern Library, 2011. Kindle edition.

### "The World and the Jug" – Excerpt 2

> "Wright believed in the much abused idea that novels are "weapons"—the counterpart of the dreary notion, common
> among most minority groups, that novels are instruments of good public relations. But I believe that true
> novels, even when most pessimistic and bitter, arise out of an impulse to celebrate human life and therefore
> are ritualistic and ceremonial at their core. Thus they would preserve as they destroy, affirm as they reject." 
> -Ralph Ellison, “The World and the Jug”, in *The Collected Essays of Ralph 
> Ellison*, ed. John F.Callahan, Modern Library, 2011. Kindle edition.

### *Invisible Man* – Excerpt 1 

> "I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe; nor am 
> I one of your Hollywood-movie extoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber
> and liquids -- and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply
> because people refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows,
> it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they approach
> me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination -- indeed, everything
> and anything except me." — Ralph Ellison, "Prologue," *Invisible Man*, Modern Library, 1995. Kindle edition.

### *Invisible Man* – Excerpt 2

> "In my hole in the basement there are exactly 1,369 lights. I've wired the entire ceiling, every inch of
> it. And not with fluorescent bulbs, but with the older, more-expensive-to-operate kind, the filament type.
> An act of sabotage, you know. I've already begun to write the wall. A junk man I know, a man of vision,
> has supplied me with wire and sockets. Nothing, storm or flood, must get in the way of our need for light
> and ever more and brighter light. The truth is the light and the light is the truth. When I finish all
> four walls, then I'll start on the floor." — Ralph Ellison, "Prologue," *Invisible Man*, 
> Modern Library, 1995. Kindle edition.

### *Invisible Man* – Excerpt 3
>"There is a certain acoustical deadness in my hole, and when I have music I want to *feel* its
> vibration, not only with my ear but with my whole body. I'd like to hear five recordings of Louis Armstrong
> playing and singing "What Did I Do to Be so Black and Blue" -- all at the same time. Sometimes now I listen
> to Louis while I have my favorite dessert of vanilla ice cream and sloe gin. I pour the red liquid over
> the white mound, watching it glisten and the vapor rising as Louis bends that military instrument 
> into a beam of lyrical sound. Perhapes I like Louis Armstrong because he's made poetry out of
> being invisible. I think it must be because he's unaware that he *is* invisible. And my own grasp of
> invisibility aids me to understand his music." — Ralph Ellison, "Prologue," *Invisible Man*, 
> Modern Library, 1995. Kindle edition.

### *Invisible Man* – Excerpt 4

>"It's so long ago and far away that here in my invisibility I wonder if it happened at all. The in my mind's
> eye I see the bronze statute of the college Founder, the cold Father symbol, his hands outstretched in the 
> breathtaking gesture of lifting a veil that flutters in hard, metallic folds above the face of a kneeling 
> slave; and I am standing puzzled, unable to decide whether the veil is really being lifted, or lowered
> more firmly in place; wheter I am witnessing a revelation or a more efficient blinding. And as I gaze,
> there is a rustle of wings and I see a flock of starlings flighting before me and, when I look again,
> the bronze face, whose empty eyes look upon a world I have never see, runs with liquid chalk -- 
> creating another ambiguity to puzzle my groping mind: Why is a bird-soiled statue more commanding
> than one that is clean?" — Ralph Ellison, "Chapter 2," *Invisible Man*, Modern Library, 1995. Kindle edition.

### *Invisible Man* – Excerpt 5

>"THEY moved in a tight-knit order, carrying sticks and clubs, shotguns and rifles, led by Ras the Exhorter 
> become Ras the Destroyer upon a great black horse. A new Ras of a haughty, vulgar dignity, dressed in the 
> costume of an Abyssinian chieftain; a fur cap upon his head, his arm bearing a shield, a cape made of the 
> skin of some wild animal around his shoulders. A figure more out of a dream than out of Harlem, than out of 
> even this Harlem night, yet real, alive, alarming" — Ralph Ellison, "Chapter 25," *Invisible Man*, Modern 
> Library, 1995. Kindle edition.

### "The Shadow and the Act" – Excerpt 1

> "We are recalling all this not so much as a means of indicting Hollywood as by way of placing 
> *Intruder in the Dust*, and such recent fils as *Home of the Brave*, *Lost Boundaries* and
> *Pinky*, in perspective. To direct an attack upon Hollywood would indeed be to confuse
> portrayal with action, image with reality. In the beginning was not the shadow but the act, 
> and the province of Holly is not action, but illusion. Actually, the anti-Negro images of the films
> were (and are) acceptable because of the existence throughout the United States of an audience 
> obssessed with an inner psychological need to view Negroes as less than men. Thus, psychologically
> and ethically, these negative images constitute justifications for all those acts, legal, 
> emotional, economic, and political, which we label Jim Crow. The anti-Negro image is a ritual
> object of which Hollywood is not the creator, but the manipulator. Its role has been that of 
> justifying the widely held myth of Negro unhumanness and inferiority by offering entertaining
> rituals through which that myth could be reaffirmed." - Ralph Ellison, “The Shadow and the Act”, in 
> *The Collected Essays of Ralph Ellison*, ed. John F.Callahan, Modern Library, 2011. Kindle edition.

### "The Shadow and the Act" – Excerpt 2

> "After Reconstruction the political question of what was to be done with Negroes, "solved" by the 
> Hayes-Tilden deal of 1876, came down to the psychological question: "How can the Negro's Humanity
> be evaded?" The problem, arising in a democracy that holds all men as created equal, was a highly
> moral one; democratic ideals had to be squared with anti-Negro practices. One answer was to 
> *deny* the Negro's humanity, a pattern set long before 1915. But with the release of 
> *The Birth of a Nation* the propagation of subhuman images of Negroes became financially and 
> deramatically profitable. The Negro as scapegoat could be sold as entertainment; it could even be exported.
> If the film became tha main manipulator of the American dream, for Negroes that dream contained a strong dose
> of such stuff as nightmares are made of."  - Ralph Ellison, “The Shadow and the Act”, in 
> *The Collected Essays of Ralph Ellison*, ed. John F.Callahan, Modern Library, 2011. Kindle edition.

### "Richard Wright's Blues" – Excerpt 1

> "The blues is an impulse to keep the painful details and episodes of a brutal experience alive in one's 
> aching consciousness, to finger its jagged grain, and to transcend it, not by the consolation of 
> philosophy but by squeezing from it a near-tragic, near-comic lyricism. As a form, the blues is an 
> autobiographical chronicle of personal catastrophe expressed lyrically. And certainly Wright's early 
> childhood was crammed with catastrophic incidents" - Ralph Ellison, “Richard Wright's Blues”, in 
> *The Collected Essays of Ralph Ellison*, ed. John F.Callahan, Modern Library, 2011. Kindle edition.
